# GF Friendly

Gluten free (or GF) Friendly is a full stack web app with user-centric CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality. 

It was created for users and visitors to find safe places to eat out with a gluten allergy. It's inspired by the existing web and mobile app [Find Me Gluten Free](https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/), but with added functionality of specifying safe menu items. 

## Getting started

**Click [here](https://gf-friendly.herokuapp.com/) to launch the app!**  

The landing page (seen below) will allow you to log in with Google OAuth. From there you can browse as you please! Visitors can view restaurants, user comments, and safe menu items, while users can create and edit restaurants, delete the restaurants they have used, leave a single comment on any restaurant, and add and delete as many safe menu items as they please.

## Next steps

Consuming a third party API from somewhere such as [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) would make it easier on the user by automatically filling in restaurant info based on a business name search. Other icebox features include...

* a filter search feature on the restaurants index page, based on cuisine type or location
* map functionality as a visual tool for users
* some sort of 'favoriting' function so that users could keep a collection of their favorite restaurants
* menu verification so that outdated or incorrect menu items would be automatically removed
